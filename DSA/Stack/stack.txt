Stack is an linear data structure : first in last out 

functions can be performed on Stack are:

    PUSH: push is an opperation that pushes a value to the top of the stack,
        if the stack is full then it will throw an alert.
    POP: pop is an opperation that pop a value from the top of the stack,
        if the stack is underflow/enmty then it will throw an alert.

    index: index is an opperation accepts an values ( that can be value that is there in the stack or the index value),
        if its value in the stack then it should return the index of the value where it lies in the stack.
        if its a index value then it should return the value that is present in the index of stack.
    
    // NOTE: there is no default/builtin stack so use array then this below are possible in JS.
    
    The above are basic functions/opperation that maxmimum knows about,
    but  if we implement the stack in JS there are two more shift and unshift 
        SHIFT: shift is similar to the pop but it follows from the bottom.
        UNSHIFT: unshift is similar to the push it follows from the bottom.
        this opperations are destructive -> they modify the original array.
        the above shift and unshift methods take more time they increase the timecomplexity.

    this are below are can be implemented by user.

    PEAK: peak is an opperation that returns the top value of the stack.
    IS-EMPTY: is-empty opperation  return boolean value the is the stack is empty return true ? false.
